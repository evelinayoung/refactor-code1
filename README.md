# refactor code 
My fbran-octo-telegramirst challenge was to refactor code, I was able to add <header> <nav> <section> and <article> to the HTML 

Edits were made to the css to consolidate some of the repeated styles 

Comments of the CSS and HTMl were made to be more readable 

atl was added to each image and icon for accesiblity
